PhyloPyPruner is a Python package for tree-based orthology inference that is
used to refine the output of a graph-based approach by removing sequences
related via gene duplication. See gitlab.com/fethalen/phylopypruner for
details.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, -V, --version     display the version number and exit
  --output <directory>  set output directory; DEFAULT: same directory as the
                        input alignments
  --wrap <max column>   wrap output sequences at column <max column>; sequence
                        data is kept at a single line by default
  --threads <count>     limit the number of logical cores used for processing
                        files in parallel
  --overwrite           overwrite an older run, if it exist within the output
                        directory
  --no-plot             shorten the run time by not generating any plot

input files (MSA and tree or directory):
  --msa <MSA>           path to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in FASTA
                        format
  --tree <tree>         path to a Newick tree file
  --dir <directory>     path to a directory containing multiple MSAs and trees

prefiltering:
  --min-taxa <threshold>
                        minimum number of OTUs allowed in output; DEFAULT: 4
  --min-len <threshold>
                        remove sequences shorter than <threshold>
  --min-support <threshold>
                        collapse nodes with a support value below <threshold>
                        into polytomies; in percent or in decimal format
                        (0.0-1.0)
  --trim-lb <factor>    remove sequences with a branch length that is <factor>
                        times larger than the standard deviation of all
                        branches within its tree
  --min-pdist <distance>
                        remove pairs of sequences with a tip-to-tip distance
                        that is less than <distance>
  --include <OTU> [<OTU> ...]
                        include the OTUs in the specified list, even if they
                        were deemed problematic by '--trim-freq-paralogs' or
                        '--trim-divergent'
  --exclude <OTU> [<OTU> ...]
                        exclude these OTUs in this run
  --force-inclusion <OTU> [<OTU> ...]
                        do not output any orthologs where these OTUs are not
                        present
  --min-otu-occupancy <percentage>
                        remove OTUs with less occupancy than <percentage> from
                        the supermatrix; in percent or in decimal format
                        (0.0-1.0)
  --min-gene-occupancy <percentage>
                        remove genes with less occupancy than <percentage>
                        from the supermatrix; in percent or in decimal format
                        (0.0-1.0)

tree-based orthology inference:
  --outgroup <OTU> [<OTU> ...]
                        root trees using one or more outgroup OTUs if at least
                        one outgroup OTU is present and that the ones that are
                        present are non-repetetive and form a monophyletic
                        group
  --root {midpoint}     root trees using this method in case no outgroups were
                        provided or if outgroup rooting fails
  --mask {longest,pdist}
                        specify the method for masking monophylies; DEFAULT:
                        pairwise distance ('pdist')
  --prune {LS,MI,MO,RT,1to1}
                        set the paralogy pruning method; default is largest
                        subtree ('LS')

decontamination:
  --trim-freq-paralogs <factor>
                        remove OTUs with a paralogy frequency (PF) larger than
                        <factor> times the standard deviation of the PF for
                        all OTUs
  --trim-divergent <percentage>
                        exclude OTUs on a per-alignment basis, where the ratio
                        between the maximum pairwise distance between
                        sequences within the OTU and the average pairwise
                        distance between sequences outside the OTU exceeds the
                        user-defined percentage
  --jackknife           leave out each OTU one by one and output statistics
                        for each OTU left out into the summary file; use the '
                        --exclude' flag in a subsequent run to remove taxa
                        deemed as problematic
  --subclades <subclade definition file>
                        specify a set of subclades and analyse their overall
                        stability
